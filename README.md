# Google-Data-Analyst-Cerificate-Case-Study
As a part of the final course in the Google Data Analytics Specialization, I have completed this case study deleaing with A bike Share company's sales data for over a period of 2-3 years.
I haven't attached the csv files here, since they were over 1 GB in size.
Here, you will find all the steps I followed in order to clean, analyse and compile/join datasets for completing the case study.
